# Weather

This is a simple weather application in Elixir that uses the Visual Crossingâ€™s API to get the current weather data for a given location. This project will be used to explore testing in Elixir.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `weather` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:weather, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
